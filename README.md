# Next.js 15 App Router Middleware: Unexpected Header/Cookie Access Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's `app` directory when using middleware to access request headers or cookies within server components. The issue results in inconsistent or incorrect behavior, often causing authentication/authorization failures.

The `middleware.js` file contains the problematic middleware code.  The `middlewareSolution.js` provides a solution to address this problem.

## Problem Description

When attempting to access request headers (like `Authorization`) or cookies in a middleware function within the `app` directory, the values may be missing or incorrect, leading to unexpected failures in server component functions that rely on these headers for authorization.

## Solution

The solution often involves careful consideration of how headers and cookies are set and accessed within the context of both the middleware and the relevant server components. This can involve adjusting the order of operations or using a more robust approach for header/cookie management.
