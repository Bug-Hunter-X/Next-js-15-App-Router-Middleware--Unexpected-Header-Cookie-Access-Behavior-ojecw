In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `app` directory and server components with specific middleware configurations.  The issue manifests as unexpected behavior or complete failure when a middleware function attempts to access request headers or cookies. This typically happens when the middleware is intended to perform authentication or authorization checks based on these headers.
